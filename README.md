## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Open Directly (No Server)
The platform is fully offline-capable. Simply open `legacy/index.html` in any modern browser.

```bash
# Windows – double-click index.html, or:
start legacy/index.html
```

### Option 2: Node.js Server (Recommended for Persistent Storage)

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
# → Visit http://localhost:5000
```

### Option 3: Python/Flask Server

```bash
cd legacy/backend
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
# → Visit http://localhost:5000
```

Both backends expose identical API endpoints and use the same `ecotree_*` localStorage key naming convention. The frontend auto-detects which backend is active and falls back to localStorage if neither is running.

## 🌳 Species Database

42+ Indian tree species with:
- CO₂ absorption rate (kg/year)
- Water conservation potential
- Cooling effect (°C per 100 trees)
- Oxygen production rate
- Growth speed classification
- Soil type compatibility
- Climate zone suitability

---

## 🏙️ Cities Database

100+ Indian cities including all state capitals, tier-1 and tier-2 cities, with:

## 📊 Environmental Calculations

All calculations are based on peer-reviewed environmental science:

- **CO₂ Absorption**: Species-specific absorption rates × climate index × tree count × years
- **O₂ Production**: ~1.07 kg O₂ per kg CO₂ absorbed (photosynthesis equation)
- **Water Conservation**: Species water-holding coefficient × leaf area index
- **Temperature Reduction**: Urban heat island mitigation model (0.1–0.8°C per 100 trees)
- **Green City Score**: Weighted composite of AQI (35%), tree density (30%), green cover (25%), population density (10%)
